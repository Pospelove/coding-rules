C++ Programming Insights: Decompose into specialized handlers.

Dealing with a massive code block that does too much? Debugging those monsters can feel impossible and adding new features? Forget about it!

Break down large functions into smaller, specialized handlers. A central dispatcher decides which handler to use, simplifying logic and isolating changes.

This is crucial in AI coding! Makes complex AI behaviors like decision-making modular, testable, and adaptable. Cleaner code, better AI.
