C++ Programming Insights: Decouple data, serialize easily.

Are you tired of wrestling with multiple serialization formats for your data? Constantly rewriting code to handle JSON, binary, or other formats? It's time to simplify!

The Archive pattern decouples your data structures from specific serialization methods. Implement a single `Serialize` method that interacts with a generic `Archive` interface. This ensures flexibility.
