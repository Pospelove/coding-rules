C++ Programming Insights: Build data, separate logic.

Tired of tangled code where data classes are burdened with complex creation logic? It's a common issue leading to bloated classes and tight coupling. Maintenance becomes a nightmare!

The solution? Isolate data representation from construction logic. Use a dedicated Factory or Builder to create data objects. Keep data classes clean, focusing solely on data representation.

This principle shines in AI coding. When AI generates complex data structures, factories ensure clean, maintainable code by separating data definition from the AI's generation process. #AICoding #SoftwareDesign #CleanCode #FactoryPattern #SOLIDPrinciples
