C++ Programming Insights: Log errors, don't crash.

Are your systems crashing due to unexpected errors? Unhandled exceptions can lead to frustrating instability, especially in critical applications like VMs, game engines or servers. A single script error shouldn't bring down your whole system.

The solution is graceful error handling. Validate inputs. If an error occurs, stop the operation, return a safe value (like null or 0), and log a detailed error message. This prevents crashes, simplifies control flow, and improves debuggability.

Applying this rule is crucial for AI-assisted coding. Logging and predictable error handling gives AI better context to diagnose and fix issues, enabling more reliable AI-generated code. #ErrorHandling #SoftwareEngineering #Resilience #AICoding #Debugging
