C++ Programming Insights: Relax preconditions, improve robustness.

Tired of sifting through endless logs filled with irrelevant warnings? Do you find yourself writing the same "if exists" checks over and over before calling a function? You're not alone.

Relax your function preconditions! Change "fail if X isn't true" to "ensure Y becomes true." Make the function handle common edge cases gracefully.

This approach simplifies AI coding significantly. AI agents can call functions with intent, not just current state, leading to more robust and adaptable systems. #AICoding #SoftwareEngineering #DesignByContract #Robustness #CodeQuality
