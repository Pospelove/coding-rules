C++ Programming Insights: Rename functions during changes.

Refactoring a core function? Ever made a change and missed a spot, leading to bugs? It's a pain we all know.

Rename, don't modify! Change the function's name when you alter its signature or behavior. This forces the compiler to catch every single usage.

When AI coding assistants propose refactors, renaming functions ensures every change is deliberate and compiler-verified, preventing silent errors. #refactoring #cpp #coding #AI #programming #softwaredevelopment #compiler #devops
