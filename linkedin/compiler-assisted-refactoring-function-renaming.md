C++ Programming Insights: Rename functions during changes.

Tired of subtle bugs after refactoring? Changing a function's signature can lead to unexpected type conversions and silent failures that are hard to spot.

Rename the function instead of modifying it in place. The compiler will then flag every call site, guaranteeing a complete and deliberate migration to the new signature.

This is crucial for AI coding tools. By renaming, the compiler becomes the final, definitive verifier of the AI's changes, ensuring safety and accuracy! #cpp #refactoring #programming #ai #coding #softwareengineering
