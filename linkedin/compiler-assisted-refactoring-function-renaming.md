C++ Programming Insights: Rename functions during refactoring.

Are you terrified of breaking your code during a refactor? Changing a core function's signature can introduce subtle errors and silent failures that are incredibly difficult to track down.

The solution? Instead of modifying functions in-place, rename them! This forces the compiler to flag every single call site, guaranteeing a complete and deliberate migration to the new version.

When using AI coding assistants, compiler-assisted refactoring becomes crucial. Renaming ensures the AI correctly adapts every call, making code safer and easier to refactor. #cpp #refactoring #coding #ai #softwareengineering #programming
