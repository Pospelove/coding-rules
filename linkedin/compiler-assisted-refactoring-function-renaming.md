C++ Programming Insights: Rename functions during changes.

Facing refactoring woes? Changing a function's core can introduce subtle bugs and implicit conversions that compilers often miss, leading to unexpected runtime behavior.

Rename the function instead of modifying it in-place! This forces the compiler to flag every single call site, ensuring a complete and deliberate migration. No missed spots, just clear errors guiding you to a robust solution.

This rule is a game-changer for AI coding tools. Rename functions to transform ambiguous refactoring tasks into verifiable, compiler-driven processes. Trust the errors, not just the code.
