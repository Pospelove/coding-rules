C++ Programming Insights: Rename functions during refactoring.

Ever refactor a widely-used function and worry about missing a call site or introducing subtle bugs? Changing signatures is risky; implicit conversions can hide unintended behavior.

Rename, don't modify. Let the compiler be your guide. Renaming forces compile-time errors at every call site, guaranteeing complete and deliberate migration to the new function contract.

This is crucial for AI coding assistants. Renaming clarifies the task: replace `old_name` with `new_name`. The compiler then validates the AI's work, ensuring accuracy and preventing errors. #Refactoring #Cpp #CodeQuality #AICoding #SoftwareEngineering
