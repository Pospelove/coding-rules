C++ Programming Insights: Rename functions during refactoring.

Refactoring a function's core behavior can be risky. Subtle errors can slip through if parameter types or semantics shift unexpectedly, leading to runtime bugs.

Rename the function instead of modifying it directly. This turns all previous call sites into compiler errors, forcing you to review and update each usage individually.

Applying this to AI coding tools ensures complete and safe refactoring. The compiler validates the AI's work, preventing subtle errors during complex code modifications. #cpp #refactoring #coding #ai #softwareengineering #programming
